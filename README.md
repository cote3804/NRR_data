# NRR_data
This is the repository that contains the calculation data for [Revised Nitrogen Reduction Scaling Relations from Potential-Dependent Modeling of Chemical and Electrochemical Steps](https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c01978) and [Mapping the Binary Covalent Alloy Space to Pursue Superior Nitrogen Reduction Reaction Catalysts](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aenm.202304559).

All data is accessbile here in json format and now in the publicly available [BEAST DB](https://beastdb.nrel.gov/).
